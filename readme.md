Spotify API

Get your most listened to tracks from Spotify. For some reason, Spotify doesn't show you your top tracks in-app, even though this data is exposed on the API. This provides a clean way to extract this information, create a playlist with your top tracks for a given period, or create a playlist based on a song.
